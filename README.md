#### Domotics project using an Android device and a Raspberry Pi.

> Smart home automation let users control what's going on in their home from their phone and assign actions that should happen depending on time or other sensor readings such as light, temperature or sound from any device in the Home Automation network.

* As the android application is password protected ,it automatically adds security to your home as it can be controlled by the user only.
* Automate your indoor lightening, outdoor lightening and fan/AC to switch ON/OFF automatically when the light intensity and temperature conditions exceed the programmed threshold values.(This feature, we named it “SENSOMATE”).
